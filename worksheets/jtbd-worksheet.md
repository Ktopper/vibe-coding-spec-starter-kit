# Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) Worksheet
## Understanding What Your Users Actually Need

The JTBD framework helps you understand the true "job" your app is being "hired" to do. This isn't about features—it's about understanding the functional, emotional, and social dimensions of your user's needs.

---

## 📖 THE FRAMEWORK

Every product serves three types of jobs:

1. **Functional Job:** The practical task it completes
2. **Emotional Job:** How it makes the user feel
3. **Social Job:** What using it says about the user

**Example: Spotify**
- Functional: Play music
- Emotional: Feel entertained, discover new music, nostalgia
- Social: "I have good taste in music"

## 📝 YOUR APP'S JTBD ANALYSIS

### Part 1: Functional Job
**What task does your app complete?**

Fill in the blank:
"When I _________________, I want to _________________, so I can _________________."

Example:
- "When I **need to focus**, I want to **follow a structured work session**, so I can **actually finish my work**."
- "When I **apply for a job**, I want to **check if my resume is competitive**, so I can **improve my chances**."

**Your app:**
When I ________________________________,
I want to ________________________________,
so I can ________________________________.

**Follow-up questions:**
- What is the user trying to accomplish?
- What outcome do they want?
- What prevents them from achieving this today?
- How do they solve this problem now (if at all)?

**Notes:**

### Part 2: Emotional Job
**How should your app make users feel?**

Check all that apply, then circle the top 3:

- [ ] Creative
- [ ] Validated
- [ ] Relieved (anxiety reduction)
- [ ] Other: _______________

**The emotional job is:**
My app makes users feel _________________ because it _________________.

Example:
- "My focus timer makes users feel **in control** because it **breaks down overwhelming work into manageable chunks**."
- "My resume roaster makes users feel **prepared and confident** because it **exposes weaknesses before employers see them**."

**Why does this emotion matter to your user?**


**What causes this emotion? (Specific features or moments)**


---

### Part 3: Social Job
**What does using your app say about the user?**

Consider:
- What identity does your user want to project?
- What tribe do they want to belong to?
- What do they want others to think about them?

**Fill in:**
Using my app signals that I am _________________________________.

Example:
- "Using my focus timer signals that I am **serious about my productivity**."
- "Using my resume tool signals that I am **thorough and detail-oriented**."

**Who is the user signaling to?**
- [ ] Themselves (self-identity)
- [ ] Peers / Colleagues
- [ ] Friends / Family
- [ ] Employers / Clients
- [ ] Social media followers
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Does your user want to share their usage publicly?**
- [ ] Yes (they're proud to use this)
- [ ] No (this is private)
- [ ] Maybe (depends on context)

## 🎯 SYNTHESIS: TIME-TO-VALUE

**The core principle:** Users "hire" your app to get a job done. How quickly can they experience success?

### Time-to-Value Analysis
**How long from opening your app to experiencing the first job completion?**

Measure your current experience:
1. Open app: _____ seconds
2. Understand what to do: _____ seconds
3. Input required information: _____ seconds
4. Wait for processing: _____ seconds
5. See valuable result: _____ seconds

**Total time-to-value:** _____ seconds

**Goal: Under 30 seconds for most utility tools.**

**Friction points to eliminate:**
- Account creation requirements?
- Unclear instructions?
- Unnecessary fields?
- Slow processing?
- Confusing results display?

**Your biggest friction point:**


**How to eliminate it:**

## 📊 VALIDATION QUESTIONS

Before building, validate your assumptions:

### User Research Questions
**Ask potential users:**

1. "When was the last time you tried to [functional job]?"
2. "What did you use? How did it go?"
3. "What was frustrating about it?"
4. "If you could wave a magic wand, what would make this easier?"
5. "How did you feel during/after the experience?"

**Record their answers:**

## 🎨 AESTHETIC IMPLICATIONS

Your JTBD analysis should inform design choices:

### If the emotional job is "calm/peaceful":
- Use soft colors, generous whitespace
- Avoid busy animations, loud notifications
- Prioritize simplicity over feature density

### If the emotional job is "confident/empowered":
- Use bold typography, clear CTAs
- Show progress indicators, success states
- Celebrate user actions

### If the emotional job is "in control":
- Give users choices, customization
- Show what's happening (no mystery)
- Allow undo, provide escape hatches

**Based on your app's emotional job, what design principles should you follow?**
1. _______________________________________________
2. _______________________________________________
3. _______________________________________________

## 💭 REMINDER

**People don't want your app. They want the job done.**

Your app is a means to an end. The better and faster you can get users to their desired outcome, the more valuable your app becomes.

**Stop building features. Start completing jobs.**

## 📚 COMPLETE EXAMPLES

Below are two filled-out JTBD analyses so you can see what "good" looks like.

### EXAMPLE 1: Focus Recipes (Timer App)

**Part 1: Functional Job**
When I **need to focus on important work**, I want to **follow a structured work session with breaks**, so I can **actually finish my work without burning out**.

**Part 2: Emotional Job**
My app makes users feel **in control and accomplished** because it **breaks down overwhelming work into manageable phases with clear progress**.

Top 3 Emotions: In control, Accomplished, Relieved (anxiety reduction)

**Part 3: Social Job**
Using my app signals that I am **serious about my productivity and intentional about my work habits**.

**Time-to-Value:** 10 seconds (Open → See recipes → Tap one → Timer starts)

**Design Implications:**
- Full-screen timer (minimize distractions)
- Breathing animations (reinforces calm/control)
- No statistics dashboard (adds complexity, not value)
- Bottom-placed controls (thumb zone)

---

### EXAMPLE 2: Resume Roaster (AI Wrapper)

**Part 1: Functional Job**
When I **apply for competitive jobs**, I want to **check if my resume is actually competitive**, so I can **improve it before real recruiters see it**.

**Part 2: Emotional Job**
My app makes users feel **prepared and confident** because it **exposes weaknesses before employers see them**.

Top 3 Emotions: Confident, Prepared, Smart

**Part 3: Social Job**
Using my app signals that I am **thorough, detail-oriented, and serious about my career**.

**Time-to-Value:** 42 seconds (Open → Paste resume → Click → Wait 5s → See results)

**Design Implications:**
- Dark theme with red accents (edgy "roast" aesthetic)
- Large text area for full resume (functional priority)
- Numerical score (concrete benchmark, confidence boost)
- NO gentle language (honest = trustworthy = prepared feeling)
- Progress messages during AI processing (reduces perceived wait)
